# Setting up Multi-Player Game Testing

- You will need **two** separate chrome browser instances with metamask installed
- The easiest way to accomplish this is by creating a second chrome profile and installing metamask again
- You will need to add hardhat network to your metamask on both profiles
- Note: hardhat network is a local netork used for testing
